            <li>Cream together room temperature butter and sugar in a bowl. Once the butter sugar mixture is done, add vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Mix in the flour until a dough-like consistency starts to form.</li>
            <li>On a well floured surface, roll the cookie dough with a rolling pin until it is 1/8 inches thick.</li>
            <li>Using a pug cookie cutter, or paper template, cut out shapes in the cookie dough. Cut out a semi-circle hole for the mouth.</li>
            <li>Take the scraps of cookie dough and add a pinch of cocoa powder until a light brown color is achieved. On a well floured surface, roll the cookie dough with a rolling pin until it is 1/8 inches thick. Cut out semi-circles and place inside the hole previously cut out.</li>
            <li>Use a toothpick to poke holes in the light brown semi-circle cookie dough.</li>
            <li>Place the cookies on parchment paper 2” apart and refrigerate for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven at 325ºF for 8-10 minutes or until bottoms are lightly golden. Remove cookies from baking sheet and cool on wire racks.</li>
            <li>Microwave dark chocolate for 30 seconds until there are no lumps. Use a toothpick to paint the details on the cookies.</li>
            <li>Microwave white chocolate for 30 seconds until there are no lumps. Add a small amount of dark chocolate to get a shade of brown just lighter than milk chocolate. Use a toothpick to paint the details on the cookies.</li>
